                <p class="intro-extended">Content strategy is evolving faster than ever. Companies are racing to create more content to position themselves as authorities and experts in their niche. The problem is â€” most of that content is AI-generated without a human in the loop. I'm that human in the loop. I create expert-led content (sometimes with the help of AI) to build authority, speak to humans by writing like a human, and get real results.</p>

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>I've spent almost a decade building content strategies, executing them with obsessive attention to quality, and delivering results that actually move the needle. I'm currently Managing Editor at GrowthX AI, where I build content strategies, manage teams, and create content pipelines at scale.</p>
            
            <p>Before this, I spent nearly three years at Semrush honing my SEO and content knowledge. I'm an expert in on-page SEO and technical SEO (including creating schema and conducting content audits), and also have experience in building programmatic SEO pipelines. My time at Semrush taught me how to assess content quality, look at data, and figure out what's working and what needs to change.</p>

            <p>I've also had three years of client-facing experience through Animalz and GrowthX AI, working with companies like Buffer, Hotjar, Zapier, Metronome, and Webflow. I'm good at managing accounts, leading meetings, presenting strategies, and keeping projects on track while collaborating with writers, developers, designers, and analysts.</p>

            <div class="personality-note">
                <p><strong>How I work:</strong> I build systems so my ADD brain doesn't have to remember everything. I'm obsessed with automation and quality checks that make everyone's lives easier without sacrificing the human touch. I use AI to speed up execution, but I'm always the human in the loop making sure content actually sounds like it was written by a person who knows what they're talking about.</p>
